I don't get it...\\r\\n\\r\\nMessy rolls that all tasted the same.  We ordered the tootsie roll and the crunch roll, both tasted similar, except of course for the crunchy captain crunch on top.  Just a mushy mess, that was hard to eat.  Bland tempura.  No bueno.  I did, however, have a very good tuna poke salad, but I would not go back just for that. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want good sushi on the west side, or the entire valley for that matter, say no to Sakana and yes to Tokyo Lobby.\""
